Hey, I am Aheli

Learning
(1). Once you change the file, you can track it using $git status

(2). If you want to push some files into server/cloud, use 

step 1:

$git add <file_name>

$git add .
It will add all the changed changes

step 2:

Commit the changes with message

$git commit -m "your commit message"

step 3:

$git push

Now all the changes are saved into the cloud/server.


--> if you want to pull any cloud changes, use $git pull
